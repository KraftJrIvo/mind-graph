Positive values are selected in increasing order. When tabIndex is 0\n  *     source order is used. A negative value omits the viewer from the tabbing order.\n  *\n  * @property {Array} overlays Array of objects defining permanent overlays of\n  *     the viewer. The overlays added via this option and later removed with\n  *     {@link OpenSeadragon.Viewer#removeOverlay} will be added back when a new\n  *     image is opened.\n  *     To add overlays which can be definitively removed, one must use\n  *     {@link OpenSeadragon.Viewer#addOverlay}\n  *     If displaying a sequence of images, the overlays can be associated\n  *     with a specific page by passing the overlays array to the page's\n  *     tile source configuration.\n  *     Expected properties:\n  *     * x, y, (or px, py for pixel coordinates) to define the location.\n  *     * width, height in point if using x,y or in pixels if using px,py.

A relative path to load a DZI file from the server.\n  *     Prefer the newer Options.tileSources.\n  *\n  * @property {String} [prefixUrl='/images/']\n  *     Prepends the prefixUrl to navImages paths, which is very useful\n  *     since the default paths are rarely useful for production\n  *     environments.\n  *\n  * @property {OpenSeadragon.NavImages} [navImages]\n  *     An object with a property for each button or other built-in navigation\n  *     control, eg the current 'zoomIn', 'zoomOut', 'home', and 'fullpage'.\n  *     Each of those in turn provides an image path for each state of the button\n  *     or navigation control, eg 'REST', 'GROUP', 'HOVER', 'PRESS'. Finally the\n  *     image paths, by default assume there is a folder on the servers root path\n  *     called '/images', eg '/images/zoomin_rest.png'.  If you need to adjust\n  *     these paths, prefer setting the option.prefixUrl rather than overriding\n  *     every image path directly through this setting.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [debugMode=false]\n  *     TODO: provide an in-screen panel providing event detail feedback.\n  *\n  * @property {String} [debugGridColor=['#437AB2', '#1B9E77', '#D95F02', '#7570B3', '#E7298A', '#66A61E', '#E6AB02', '#A6761D', '#666666']]\n  *     The colors of grids in debug mode. Each tiled image's grid uses a consecutive color.\n  *     If there are more tiled images than provided colors, the color vector is recycled.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [silenceMultiImageWarnings=false]\n  *     Silences warnings when calling viewport coordinate functions with multi-image.\n  *     Useful when you're overlaying multiple images on top of one another.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [blendTime=0]\n  *     Specifies the duration of animation as higher or lower level tiles are\n  *     replacing the existing tile.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [alwaysBlend=false]\n  *     Forces the tile to always blend.  By default the tiles skip blending\n  *     when the blendTime is surpassed and the current animation frame would\n  *     not complete the blend.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [autoHideControls=true]\n  *     If the user stops interacting with the viewport, fade the navigation\n  *     controls.  Useful for presentation since the controls are by default\n  *     floated on top of the image the user is viewing.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [immediateRender=false]\n  *     Render the best closest level first, ignoring the lowering levels which\n  *     provide the effect of very blurry to sharp. It is recommended to change\n  *     setting to true for mobile devices.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [defaultZoomLevel=0]\n  *     Zoom level to use when image is first opened or the home button is clicked.\n  *     If 0, adjusts to fit viewer.\n  *\n  * @property {String|DrawerImplementation|Array} [drawer = ['webgl', 'canvas', 'html']]\n  *     Which drawer to use. Valid strings are 'webgl', 'canvas', and 'html'. Valid drawer\n  *     implementations are constructors of classes that extend OpenSeadragon.DrawerBase.\n  *     An array of strings and/or constructors can be used to indicate the priority\n  *     of different implementations, which will be tried in order based on browser support.\n  *\n  * @property {Object} drawerOptions\n  *     Options to pass to the selected drawer implementation. For details\n  *     please see {@link OpenSeadragon.DrawerOptions}.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [opacity=1]\n  *     Default proportional opacity of the tiled images (1=opaque, 0=hidden)\n  *     Hidden images do not draw and only load when preloading is allowed.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [preload=false]\n  *     Default switch for loading hidden images (true loads, false blocks)\n  *\n  * @property {String} [compositeOperation=null]\n  *     Valid values are 'source-over', 'source-atop', 'source-in', 'source-out',\n  *     'destination-over', 'destination-atop', 'destination-in', 'destination-out',\n  *     'lighter', 'difference', 'copy', 'xor', etc.\n  *     For complete list of modes, please @see {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/globalCompositeOperation/ globalCompositeOperation}\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [imageSmoothingEnabled=true]\n  *     Image smoothing for canvas rendering (only if the canvas drawer is used). Note: Ignored\n  *     by some (especially older) browsers which do not support this canvas property.\n  *     This property can be changed in {@link Viewer.DrawerBase.setImageSmoothingEnabled}.\n  *\n  * @property {String|CanvasGradient|CanvasPattern|Function} [placeholderFillStyle=null]\n  *     Draws a colored rectangle behind the tile if it is not loaded yet.\n  *     You can pass a CSS color value like \"#FF8800\".\n  *     When passing a function the tiledImage and canvas context are available as argument which is useful when you draw a gradient or pattern.\n  *\n  * @property {Object} [subPixelRoundingForTransparency=null]\n  *     Determines when subpixel rounding should be applied for tiles when rendering images that support transparency.\n  *     This property is a subpixel rounding enum values dictionary [{@link BROWSERS}] --> {@link SUBPIXEL_ROUNDING_OCCURRENCES}.\n  *     The key is a {@link BROWSERS} value, and the value is one of {@link SUBPIXEL_ROUNDING_OCCURRENCES},\n  *     indicating, for a given browser, when to apply subpixel rounding.\n  *     Key '*' is the fallback value for any browser not specified in the dictionary.\n  *     This property has a simple mode, and one can set it directly to\n  *     {@link SUBPIXEL_ROUNDING_OCCURRENCES.NEVER}, {@link SUBPIXEL_ROUNDING_OCCURRENCES.ONLY_AT_REST} or {@link SUBPIXEL_ROUNDING_OCCURRENCES.ALWAYS}\n  *     in order to apply this rule for all browser. The values {@link SUBPIXEL_ROUNDING_OCCURRENCES.ALWAYS} would be equivalent to { '*', SUBPIXEL_ROUNDING_OCCURRENCES.ALWAYS }.\n  *     The default is {@link SUBPIXEL_ROUNDING_OCCURRENCES.NEVER} for all browsers, for backward compatibility reason.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [degrees=0]\n  *     Initial rotation.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [flipped=false]\n  *     Initial flip state.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [overlayPreserveContentDirection=true]\n  *     When the viewport is flipped (by pressing 'f'), the overlay is flipped using ScaleX.\n  *     Normally, this setting (default true) keeps the overlay's content readable by flipping it back.\n  *     To make the content flip with the overlay, set overlayPreserveContentDirection to false.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [minZoomLevel=null]\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [maxZoomLevel=null]\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [homeFillsViewer=false]\n  *     Make the 'home' button fill the viewer and clip the image, instead\n  *     of fitting the image to the viewer and letterboxing.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [panHorizontal=true]\n  *     Allow horizontal pan.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [panVertical=true]\n  *     Allow vertical pan.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [constrainDuringPan=false]\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [wrapHorizontal=false]\n  *     Set to true to force the image to wrap horizontally within the viewport.\n  *     Useful for maps or images representing the surface of a sphere or cylinder.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [wrapVertical=false]\n  *     Set to true to force the image to wrap vertically within the viewport.\n  *     Useful for maps or images representing the surface of a sphere or cylinder.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [minZoomImageRatio=0.9]\n  *     The minimum percentage ( expressed as a number between 0 and 1 ) of\n  *     the viewport height or width at which the zoom out will be constrained.\n  *     Setting it to 0, for example will allow you to zoom out infinity.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [maxZoomPixelRatio=1.1]\n  *     The maximum ratio to allow a zoom-in to affect the highest level pixel\n  *     ratio. This can be set to Infinity to allow 'infinite' zooming into the\n  *     image though it is less effective visually if the HTML5 Canvas is not\n  *     available on the viewing device.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [smoothTileEdgesMinZoom=1.1]\n  *     A zoom percentage ( where 1 is 100% ) of the highest resolution level.\n  *     When zoomed in beyond this value alternative compositing will be used to\n  *     smooth out the edges between tiles. This will have a performance impact.\n  *     Can be set to Infinity to turn it off.\n  *     Note: This setting is ignored on iOS devices due to a known bug (See {@link https://github.com/openseadragon/openseadragon/issues/952})\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [iOSDevice=?]\n  *     True if running on an iOS device, false otherwise.\n  *     Used to disable certain features that behave differently on iOS devices.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [autoResize=true]\n  *     Set to false to prevent polling for viewer size changes. Useful for providing custom resize behavior.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [preserveImageSizeOnResize=false]\n  *     Set to true to have the image size preserved when the viewer is resized. This requires autoResize=true (default).\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [minScrollDeltaTime=50]\n  *     Number of milliseconds between canvas-scroll events. This value helps normalize the rate of canvas-scroll\n  *     events between different devices, causing the faster devices to slow down enough to make the zoom control\n  *     more manageable.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [rotationIncrement=90]\n  *     The number of degrees to rotate right or left when the rotate buttons or keyboard shortcuts are activated.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [maxTilesPerFrame=1]\n  *     The number of tiles loaded per frame. As the frame rate of the client's machine is usually high (e.g., 50 fps),\n  *     one tile per frame should be a good choice. However, for large screens or lower frame rates, the number of\n  *     loaded tiles per frame can be adjusted here. Reasonable values might be 2 or 3 tiles per frame.\n  *     (Note that the actual frame rate is given by the client's browser and machine).\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [pixelsPerWheelLine=40]\n  *     For pixel-resolution scrolling devices, the number of pixels equal to one scroll line.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [pixelsPerArrowPress=40]\n  *     The number of pixels viewport moves when an arrow key is pressed.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [visibilityRatio=0.5]\n  *     The percentage ( as a number from 0 to 1 ) of the source image which\n  *     must be kept within the viewport.  If the image is dragged beyond that\n  *     limit, it will 'bounce' back until the minimum visibility ratio is\n  *     achieved.  Setting this to 0 and wrapHorizontal ( or wrapVertical ) to\n  *     true will provide the effect of an infinitely scrolling viewport.\n  *\n  * @property {Object} [viewportMargins={}]\n  *     Pushes the \"home\" region in from the sides by the specified amounts.\n  *     Possible subproperties (Numbers, in screen coordinates): left, top, right, bottom.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [imageLoaderLimit=0]\n  *     The maximum number of image requests to make concurrently. By default\n  *     it is set to 0 allowing the browser to make the maximum number of\n  *     image requests in parallel as allowed by the browsers policy.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [clickTimeThreshold=300]\n  *      The number of milliseconds within which a pointer down-up event combination\n  *      will be treated as a click gesture.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [clickDistThreshold=5]\n  *      The maximum distance allowed between a pointer down event and a pointer up event\n  *      to be treated as a click gesture.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [dblClickTimeThreshold=300]\n  *      The number of milliseconds within which two pointer down-up event combinations\n  *      will be treated as a double-click gesture.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [dblClickDistThreshold=20]\n  *      The maximum distance allowed between two pointer click events\n  *      to be treated as a double-click gesture.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [springStiffness=6.5]\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [animationTime=1.2]\n  *     Specifies the animation duration per each {@link OpenSeadragon.Spring}\n  *     which occur when the image is dragged, zoomed or rotated.\n  *\n  * @property {OpenSeadragon.GestureSettings} [gestureSettingsMouse]\n  *     Settings for gestures generated by a mouse pointer device.

The WebGLDrawer\n    * loads tile data as textures to the graphics card as soon as it is available (via the tile-ready event),\n    * and unloads the data (via the image-unloaded event). The drawer utilizes a context-dependent two pass drawing pipeline.\n    * For the first pass, tile composition for a given TiledImage is always done using a canvas with a WebGL context.\n    * This allows tiles to be stitched together without seams or artifacts, without requiring a tile source with overlap. If overlap is present,\n    * overlapping pixels are discarded. The second pass copies all pixel data from the WebGL context onto an output canvas\n    * with a Context2d context. This allows applications to have access to pixel data and other functionality provided by\n    * Context2d, regardless of whether the CanvasDrawer or the WebGLDrawer is used. Certain options, including compositeOperation,\n    * clip, croppingPolygons, and debugMode are implemented using Context2d operations; in these scenarios, each TiledImage is\n    * drawn onto the output canvas immediately after the tile composition step (pass 1). Otherwise, for efficiency, all TiledImages\n    * are copied over to the output canvas at once, after all tiles have been composited for all images.\n    * @param {Object} options - Options for this Drawer.\n    * @param {OpenSeadragon.Viewer} options.viewer - The Viewer that owns this Drawer.\n    * @param {OpenSeadragon.Viewport} options.viewport - Reference to Viewer viewport.\n    * @param {Element} options.element - Parent element.\n    * @param {Number} [options.debugGridColor] - See debugGridColor in {@link OpenSeadragon.Options} for details.\n    */\n\n    OpenSeadragon.WebGLDrawer = class WebGLDrawer extends OpenSeadragon.DrawerBase{\n        constructor(options){\n           super(options);\n\n            /**\n             * The HTML element (canvas) that this drawer uses for drawing\n             * @member {Element} canvas\n             * @memberof OpenSeadragon.WebGLDrawer#\n             */\n\n            /**\n             * The parent element of this Drawer instance, passed in when the Drawer was created.\n             * The parent of {@link OpenSeadragon.WebGLDrawer#canvas}.\n             * @member {Element} container\n             * @memberof OpenSeadragon.WebGLDrawer#\n             */\n\n            // private members\n            this._destroyed = false;\n            this._TextureMap = new Map();\n            this._TileMap = new Map();\n\n            this._gl = null;\n            this._firstPass = null;\n            this._secondPass = null;\n            this._glFrameBuffer = null;\n            this._renderToTexture = null;\n            this._glFramebufferToCanvasTransform = null;\n            this._outputCanvas = null;\n            this._outputContext = null;\n            this._clippingCanvas = null;\n            this._clippingContext = null;\n            this._renderingCanvas = null;\n            this._backupCanvasDrawer = null;\n\n            // Add listeners for events that require modifying the scene or camera\n            this._boundToTileReady = ev => this._tileReadyHandler(ev);\n            this._boundToImageUnloaded = ev => this._imageUnloadedHandler(ev);\n            this.viewer.addHandler(\"tile-ready\", this._boundToTileReady);\n            this.viewer.addHandler(\"image-unloaded\", this._boundToImageUnloaded);\n\n            // Reject listening for the tile-drawing and tile-drawn events, which this drawer does not fire\n            this.viewer.rejectEventHandler(\"tile-drawn\", \"The WebGLDrawer does not raise the tile-drawn event\");\n            this.viewer.rejectEventHandler(\"tile-drawing\", \"The WebGLDrawer does not raise the tile-drawing event\");\n\n            // this.viewer and this.canvas are part of the public DrawerBase API\n            // and are defined by the parent DrawerBase class.
